### 🖼️ Project Previews
Here are some previews of the projects I've been working on:

🎮 Java Text Adventure Game
A small Java-based console game where you explore rooms, collect items, and bring them all to a final room — but with limited moves!

🧩 Gameplay Highlights:

Move between connected rooms (e.g., kitchen, garage, living room)

Pick up scattered items (e.g., wrench, hammer)

Drop items in a designated collection room

Win by collecting all items before you run out of moves
